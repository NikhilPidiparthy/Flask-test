Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher
Flask is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
Since it does not need any tools or libraries, we can also call it a micro-framework.

WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)– A standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.

Werkzeug– A WSGI toolkit implementing requests, response objects, and other utility functions.

Jinja2
Jinja 2– A Python templating engine, Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.



Web Application Framework or simply Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications without having to bother about low-level details such as protocols, thread management etc.


Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such functionality to the application

==========================================================================================

@app.route('/flask')
def hello_flask():
   return 'Hello Flask'

@app.route('/python/')
def hello_python():
   return 'Hello Python'

Both the rules appear similar but in the second rule, trailing slash (/) is used. As a result, it becomes a canonical URL. Hence, using /python or /python/ returns the same output. However, in case of the first rule, /flask/ URL results in 404 Not Found page.


A canonical URL is the URL of the best representative page from a group of duplicate pages, according to Google. For example, if you have two URLs for the same page (such as example.com? dress=1234 and example.com/dresses/1234 ), Google chooses one as canonical.
